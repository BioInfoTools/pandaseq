PANDASEQ
========

PANDASEQ is a program to align Illumina reads, optionally with PCR primers embedded in the sequence, and reconstruct an overlapping sequence.

INSTALLATION
------------

Binary packages are available for recent versions of MacOS and Linux. Installing from source is not too difficult.

Development packages for zlib and libbz2 are needed, as is a standard compiler environment. On Ubuntu, this can be installed via
	sudo apt-get install build-essentials zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev
On MacOS, the Apple Developer tools and Fink must be installed, then
	sudo fink install bzip2-dev

After the support packages are installed, one should be able to do:
	./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && sudo make install

USAGE
-----

Please consult the manual page by invoking
	man pandaseq
